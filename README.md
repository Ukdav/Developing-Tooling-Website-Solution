In this project, I will be introducing the concept of file sharing for multiple servers to share the same web content and also a database for storing data related to the website.

In the diagram above we can see a common pattern where several stateless Web Servers share a common database and access the same files using a Network File system (NFS) as shared file storage. Even though the NFS server might be located on a completely separate hardware â€“ for Web Servers it looks like a local file system from where they can serve the same files.

This project consists of the following servers:

* Web server(RHEL)
* Database server(Ubuntu + MySQL)
* Storage/File server(RHEL + NFS server)

## Preparing NFS Server

Create an EC2 instance (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 on AWS) on which we will set up our NFS(Network File Storage) Server.

On this server, we attach 2 EBS volumes 10GB each as external storage to our instance and create 3 logical volumes on it through which we will attach mounts from our external web servers.

* 3 logical volumes *lv-opt*, *lv-apps* and *lv-logs*
* 3 mounts directory */mnt/opt*, */mnt/apps* and */mnt/logs*
* Webserver content will be stored in /apps, webserver logs in /logs, and /opt will be used by Jenkins

Steps taken to create logical volumes are shown in the last project

Install NFS Server, configure it to start on reboot, and make sure it is up and running

* sudo yum -y update
* sudo yum install nfs-utils -y
* sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service
* sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service
* sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service

![sudo yum update on nfs server](https://github.com/Ukdav/Developing-Tooling-Website-Solution/assets/139593350/318adcf9-e6cc-4520-a5b7-3dcea8fbbba9)

![sudo yum install nfs-utils -y](https://github.com/Ukdav/Developing-Tooling-Website-Solution/assets/139593350/1158b085-ee38-4140-81d4-6201770ef535)

![sudo systemctl status nfs-server service](https://github.com/Ukdav/Developing-Tooling-Website-Solution/assets/139593350/888b707d-7252-468e-adb1-197f88bb0e3a)
